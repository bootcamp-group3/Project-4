                                Once another player is available, you'll be matched and dropped into a game. Roll a
                                die
                                to see who takes the first
                                turn, then pay attention to try and outmaneuver your opponent!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You'll start on a new randomly generated game board, and your goal is to dominate
                                your
                                opponent by fortifying the
                                most tiles. Each turn, you'll begin by making a move. You can move two tiles Up,
                                Down,
                                Left, or Right, or you can
                                move one tile diagonally. Choose wisely, however, as obstacles and traps can throw
                                a
                                ranch into even the best laid
                                plans.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you move onto an empty tile, you'll have to roll a die to see what resources are
                                on the
                                tiles. If you roll a one, you become the owner of that tile and establish a
                                fortification with
                                one guard. If you roll a six, you become the owner of that tile and establish a
                                fortification of
                                six soldiers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you move onto a tile controlled by your opponent, you'll have to roll a die to
                                battle it out
                                over that square. If your dice roll is higher than the number that your opponent
                                rolled when he/she
                                captured the tile, then you emerge the victor. If your dice roll is smaller,
                                however, you suffer an
                                embarassing loss and lose the soldiers you rolled for.
